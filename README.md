# Single Page Developer Portfolio

This project was developed as a teaching tool to guide students through the process of building a fully responsive and SEO-optimized landing page. Using a design from Frontend Mentor(https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/singlepage-developer-portfolio-bBVj2ZPi-x), 
I demonstrated how to structure, style, and add functionality to a web page with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The project covered the complete development workflow, from initial setup to final deployment on Netlify, providing students with hands-on experience 
in real-world web development.
